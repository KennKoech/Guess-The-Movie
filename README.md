# Guess-The-Movie
A fascinating movie guessing game.
I developed this using Java.
The computer reads a list of movies from a file.
It then picks one of the movies at random and prompts the user to guess the movie one letter at a time.
The user has 15 guesses (I had to up it from 10 cause of movie titles like Lord of the Rings).
If the user does it in less than 15 guesses they win. Otherwise, they lose.
